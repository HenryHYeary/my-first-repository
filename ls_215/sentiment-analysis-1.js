/*
input: a long string of multiline text
output: information to the console that counts the number of positive
words included in the text as well as the specific examples of those positive
words
The same process occurs for negative text as well. The last line judges whether the
sentiment of the text is positive or negative based on the count of words.

Examples: Results appear to be designed to be case insensitive

Data Structure: should iterate through every word in each array and test to see
whether the text includes the word. If the word is included then the word should pass
a filter check for all of the positive or negative words included in the text.
