input: an array of strings, and an integer k
output: the kth "distinct" string in the array (a distinct
  string is a string that is present only once in an array)

Examples: How does case affect whether or not a string is distinct?
The result string is the one encountered earliest in the array.
How do whitespace and other non alphabetic characters influence
whether or not a string is distinct from the others?
Will the first argument be an array, if not then what should I do?
Will there always be exactly 2 inputs
